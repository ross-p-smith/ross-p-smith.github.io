# About me

![Ross Smith](/assets/images/about.jpg)

Hi, I'm a Software Engineer from the UK and working @ Microsoft since 2013. 

Currently, I'm changing focus to look at Containers and Kubernetes. My focus previously has been the full .Net stack and IIS / App Services / Service Fabric and DevOps.

Feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ross_p_smith).

Thank you so much for reading this blog!

Ross
